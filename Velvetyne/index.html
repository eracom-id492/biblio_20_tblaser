        Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest
        tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her
        thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead Well, the years start
        coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground
        running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but
        your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with
        taking the backstreets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never
        shine if you don't glow Hey now, you're an all star Get your game on, go
        play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that
        glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold
